 GidgetWorld is a clicker strategy game utilizing directional keys WASD and a mouse (or trackpad) in which the playerâ€™s final goal is to launch off in a rocket. In order to level up to the rocket, the player must spawn in Gidgets, little creatures with randomized appearances, and build up the state of the island they spawn on with structures like mines and warehouses. The Gidgets do work for you in order to gather the materials to build the rocket, with the goal of ultimately escaping the planet with your newfound friends and beating the game.
